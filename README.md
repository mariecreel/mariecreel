  <h3>Why, hello there!</h3>
<p>Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Marie Creel and I'm a full stack software engineer. I currently work at <a href="https://christianbook.com">Christianbook</a>, enhancing accessibility of web components, reducing crash rates in our native mobile eReader application, and solving problems across the tech stack. I build <a href="https://github.com/mariecreel/lolibrary-api-proxy">APIs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mariecreel/lolibrary-mobile">mobile apps</a>, <a href="https://www.hatsunem.icu">microsites</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mariecreel/leetdex">CLIs</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mariecreel/bulkrcsdiff.sh">other tools for devs</a> in my free time, too!</p>
  <p>Before my time at Christianbook, I completed an undergraduate thesis in computer science and writing at <a href="https://marlboro.emerson.edu/">Marlboro College</a>, focusing on programming languages, compiler design, and interactive hypertext literature. I designed and built <a href="https://github.com/mariecreel/TweeTeX">TweeTeX</a>, a TeX-like syntactical sugar for the <a href="https://github.com/Rizean/twee3">Twee3 programming language</a>, as part of my thesis work.</p>
  <p>I've also had the privelege of researching computer audition as a National Science Foundation Undergraduate Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/undergraduate/reu.html">University of Rochester's REU: Computational Methods for Understanding Music, Media, and Minds</a>. I worked in the <a href="http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/air/index.html">AIR Lab</a> under the supervision of Dr. Zhiyao Duan, collaborating with Ph.D candiate Christodoulos Benetatos to <a href="https://github.com/mariecreel/automatic_music_events">automate events in video jockey software</a> using real-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping">time series analysis</a>.</p>
