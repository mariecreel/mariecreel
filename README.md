### Hello there!
My name is **Marie Creel** and I'm a **full-stack software engineer**.

I build [APIs](https://github.com/mariecreel/lolibrary-api-proxy), [mobile apps](https://github.com/mariecreel/lolibrary-mobile), [microsites](https://www.hatsunem.icu), [CLIs](https://github.com/mariecreel/leetdex), and [tools for devs](https://github.com/mariecreel/bulkrcsdiff.sh) for fun, too!

I completed an undergraduate thesis in computer science and writing at [Marlboro College](https://marlboro.emerson.edu/), focusing on programming languages, compiler design, and interactive hypertext literature. I designed and built [TweeTeX](https://github.com/mariecreel/TweeTeX), a TeX-like syntactical sugar for the [Twee3 programming language](https://github.com/Rizean/twee3), as part of my thesis work.
 
I've also researched computer audition as as National Science Foundation Undergraduate Research Fellow in the [University of Rochester's NSF REU: Computational Methods for Understanding Music, Media, and Minds](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/undergraduate/reu.html). I worked in the [AIR Lab](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/air/index.html) under the supervision of Dr. Zhiyao Duan, [automating video jockey software](https://github.com/mariecreel/automatic_music_events) by analyzing real-time audio input.
